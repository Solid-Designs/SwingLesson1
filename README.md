# SwingLesson1
I am now following a swing tutorial series on Udemy. This is my first session's work.

# What I learned
I learned about how to create a panel that has text areas and buttons. 

I also learned about how to make them communicated in a: "model, view, controller" format.

This is my tutorial progress. I will continue to practice what I learned as review for a while.
